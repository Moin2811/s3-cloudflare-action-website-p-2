# üöÄ Scalable Static Website with S3 + Cloudflare + GitHub Actions

## üìå Project Overview



* **AWS S3** for storage & static hosting
* **Cloudflare** for DNS, CDN, caching, and free SSL
* **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD automation

Whenever I push code to GitHub, my website automatically updates on **S3** and Cloudflare cache is purged, ensuring instant updates across the globe.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

* **AWS S3 (Free Tier)** ‚Äì Website hosting
* **Cloudflare (Free)** ‚Äì DNS, CDN, HTTPS, caching, performance
* **GitHub Actions** ‚Äì CI/CD workflow automation
* **HTML & CSS** ‚Äì Static website content
* **Bash & AWS CLI** ‚Äì Bucket policy & configuration

## üîë Steps I Followed

### 1. Project Setup

* Created a GitHub repo with `index.html` and `style.css`.
* Registered a domain and connected it to Cloudflare.

### 2. S3 Hosting

* Created an **S3 bucket** (same name as domain).
* Enabled static website hosting.
* Applied a bucket policy to allow public access.

### 3. IAM & GitHub Secrets

* Created an IAM user with limited S3 access.
* Stored credentials in GitHub repo secrets:

  * `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
  * `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
  * `S3_BUCKET_NAME`
  * `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`
  * `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID`

### 4. GitHub Actions Workflow

* Added `.github/workflows/deploy.yml with steps:

  1. Checkout code
  2. Configure AWS credentials
  3. Sync files to S3
  4. Purge Cloudflare cache

### 5. Cloudflare Setup

* Configured DNS (CNAME ‚Üí S3 endpoint).
* Enabled **SSL/TLS Flexible mode**.
* Enabled **Auto Minify (HTML/CSS/JS)** and **Brotli compression**.
* Set caching rules for static assets.

### 6. Testing & Verification

* Edited `index.html`, committed & pushed.
* GitHub Actions ran and deployed files.
* Site updated instantly on `https://yourdomain.com`.
